Hi Everyone,

To use our project, you need to have Visual Studio Code and the necessary Django requirements installed. Our code is written in Python, and for web implementation, we use Django as the presentation application. Extract our code and run it in VS Code. With the help of Django, we can easily get a web interface.

Thank you
